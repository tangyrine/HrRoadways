## Translation Documentation

### Overview

The HrRoadways project supports bilingual functionality, allowing users to switch between English and Hindi. This is achieved through a translation logic that provides translated text for various components.

### Translation Logic Implementation

#### Translation Data Structure:
The translation data is organized in a structured format within the components. Each language has its own set of translations for different text elements.

#### State Management:
A state variable (`isHindi`) is used to toggle between English and Hindi translations.

#### Language Toggle Function:
A function (`handleToggleLanguage`) is provided to switch between languages.

### Adding Translations

#### Define Translations:
Add the translations for both English and Hindi in the respective component.

#### Use the Translation:
Use the translation logic to display the translated text based on the current language state.

#### Example: Adding Translations to a New Component

##### Define Translations:
```javascript
const translations = {
    en: {
        heading: "Your English Heading",
        description: "Your English Description",
    },
    hi: {
        heading: "आपका हिंदी शीर्षक",
        description: "आपका हिंदी विवरण",
    },
};
```

##### Use the Translation:
```javascript
const currentLanguage = isHindi ? translations.hi : translations.en;

return (
    <div>
        <h1>{currentLanguage.heading}</h1>
        <p>{currentLanguage.description}</p>
    </div>
);
```

### Example: Existing Components

#### App.jsx

The `App.jsx` file manages the routing and includes the language toggle functionality.

##### State Management and Toggle Function:
```javascript
const [isHindi, setIsHindi] = useState(false);

const handleToggleLanguage = () => setIsHindi(!isHindi);

return (
    <Router>
        <Navigation isHindi={isHindi} onToggleLanguage={handleToggleLanguage} />
        <Routes>
            <Route path="/" element={<Hero isHindi={isHindi} />} />
            {/* Other routes */}
        </Routes>
        <Footer isHindi={isHindi} />
    </Router>
);
```

##### Passing Translation State:
The `isHindi` state is passed to components that require translations, such as `Hero` and `Footer`.

#### Hero.jsx

The `Hero` component uses the translation logic to display content in the selected language.

##### Define Translations:
```javascript
const translations = {
    en: {
        heading: "Haryana Roadways - Your Own Bus Service",
        subheading: "Your Journey, Our Pride | आपकी यात्रा, हमारा गौरव",
        departure: "From",
        arrival: "To",
        button: "Search Buses",
        popular: "Popular Routes",
        allBuses: "All Buses",
        volvo: "Volvo AC",
        superExpress: "Super Express",
        ordinary: "Ordinary",
        searchPlaceholder: "Search bus stands...",
    },
    hi: {
        heading: "हरियाणा रोडवेज - आपकी अपनी बस सेवा",
        subheading: "आपकी यात्रा, हमारा गौरव",
        departure: "कहाँ से",
        arrival: "कहाँ तक",
        button: "बसें खोजें",
        popular: "लोकप्रिय मार्ग",
        allBuses: "सभी बसें",
        volvo: "वोल्वो एसी",
        superExpress: "सुपर एक्सप्रेस",
        ordinary: "साधारण",
        searchPlaceholder: "बस स्टैंड खोजें...",
    },
};
```

##### Use Translations:
```javascript
const currentLanguage = isHindi ? translations.hi : translations.en;

return (
    <div>
        <h1>{currentLanguage.heading}</h1>
        <p>{currentLanguage.subheading}</p>
        {/* Other translated elements */}
    </div>
);
```

### Best Practices

#### Apply Translation Logic:
Ensure that all new content and pages implement the translation logic.

#### Compress Images:
Use PNG or JPG files for images and always compress them to minimize size.

#### Update Forked Repo:
Before submitting a pull request, always ensure that your forked repository is up to date.

### Summary

By following this documentation, developers can effectively add and manage translations in the HrRoadways project. This ensures a consistent bilingual experience for users.
